## Predicting Employee Productivity using Tree Models

In this project I will aim to make use of decision trees and random forests to predict employee productivity in the garment industry. The garment industry is one the largest industries in the 21st century. It is also a highly labour intensive industry, therefore statisfying the huge demand is mostly dependant on the employee productivity and performance. It is highly desirable among decision makers to track and predict the productivity performance of their employees. This project will aim to do just that using the help of random forest and decision tree ML algorithims.
